# Computer-Networks-Final-Project
In this repository, I published a TCP-based chat room project written in Python.  We worked on this project as a group with my partners who are Cenk Korkmaz and Deniz Doğan Taş.

We designed a chat room, where you can chat with all your other friends that use the same network as you. Also, we prepared another window for the chat window, which is used for playing hangman while chatting with others. This hangman game is a single-player game, which means you are always against the computer. But, at the same time, you can continue chatting with others. For being able to run the server and the client part at the same time, you should use more than one CMD window for running these python files.
